= Details =

== _Romanisations_/_readings_ ==
  * Break down (_decompose_) strings into single reading entities
  * Join (_compose_) single entities together, apply formatting where needed
  * Handle various decompositions for ambiguous input
  * List of supported reading entities
  * Tonal languages:
    * Combine base syllable with tone and get tone from syllable for tonal languages
    * Choice of diacritics and tone marks, set according to placement rules
  * Reading dialects:
    * Support of various (e.g. non-standard) realisations of a reading (_reading dialect_), e.g. type face variations
    * Guessing of given reading realisation to pinpoint _reading dialect_
    * Conversion of variation to standard form
  * Analysis of syllable forms, e.g breaking into onset and rhyme

  * Conversion between readings:
    * Conversion of strings including non-reading entities
    * Preservation of upper and lower case
    * Support of user-adapted conversion for ambiguous cases
    * Error handling for ambiguous cases/conversion errors
    * Support of non-standard realisations of input reading (_reading dialect_)

=== Currently supported readings ===
  * Mandarin Chinese:
    * Pinyin
    * Gwoyeu Romatzyh
    * Wade-Giles (work in progress)
    * IPA
    * Braille
  * Yue (Cantonese):
    * Cantonese Yale
    * Jyutping
    * IPA (work in progress)
  * Korean
    * Hangul
  * Japanese
    * Kana (Hiragana & Katakana)

== Character to reading mapping ==
  * Character to reading and reading to character mappings as supported by the Unihan database for Mandarin Chinese, Yue (Cantonese) and Korean
  * Support of non-standard realisations of input reading (_reading dialect_)

== Radicals ==
  * ...

== Variants ==
  * Variant information as given by the Unihan database:
    * Compatible character forms
    * Semantic variant forms, often used interchangeably
    * Specialised semantic variant forms, often used interchangeably but limited to certain contexts
    * Z-variant forms, which only differ in typeface 
    * Simplified Chinese character forms, originating from the character simplification process of the PR China
    * Traditional character forms for a simplified Chinese character
  * Database of character variants for components and stroke decomposition on a glyph basis (see below)
  * Default mapping of glyph form for locale

== Character components ==
  * ...

== Strokes ==
  * Glyph dependant stroke count
  * ...

== Build system ==
A dependancy based, modular build system is supplied for creating the library's database from packaged data files and from [http://unicode.org/charts/unihan.html Unicode's Unihan] database. Additionally Unihan's data can be overloaded by more precise data if available.

== Dictionaries ==
Support for [http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/j_edict.html EDICT], [http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=cedict CEDICT], the [http://home.iprimus.com.au/richwarm/gr/gr.htm#grdict Gwoyeu Romatzyh Version of CEDICT] (called CEDICTGR here) and [http://www.chinaboard.de/chinesisch_deutsch.php HanDeDict] with full-text search included for command-line tool _cjknife_.
