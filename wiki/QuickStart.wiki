= Introduction =

Make sure you have [http://www.python.org/download/ Python 2.5 or newer], [http://www.sqlalchemy.org/download.html SQLalchemy] and [http://www.sqlite.org/download.html SQLite] installed (lets focus on SQLite for now). In the following steps Unix commands are shown as an example. Jump to [QuickStart#Ubuntu Ubuntu] or [QuickStart#Debian Debian] for installing a packaged version.

= Steps =

  # First download the latest release from [http://code.google.com/p/cjklib/downloads/list Downloads] and unpack it.
  {{{
  tar -xzf cjklib-0.2.tar.gz
  }}}
  # Go to the new directory
  {{{
  cd cjklib-0.2
  }}}
  # Install
  {{{
  python setup.py install
  }}}

Now you should be able to test most of the examples given under [Screenshots].

For the additionally offered dictionary functions you can:

  # Download CEDICT from [http://us.mdbg.net/chindict/export/cedict/cedict_1_0_ts_utf-8_mdbg.txt.gz]
  {{{
  wget http://us.mdbg.net/chindict/export/cedict/cedict_1_0_ts_utf-8_mdbg.txt.gz
  }}}
  # Build the tables needed
  {{{
  buildcjkdb build fullCEDICT
  }}}

That's it.

== Ubuntu ==
Add the following lines to your {{{/etc/apt/sources.list}}} (replace karmic with jaunty when on this system):
{{{
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/cburgmer/ppa/ubuntu karmic main 
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/cburgmer/ppa/ubuntu karmic main
}}}

Then do a {{{sudo aptitude update}}} followed by {{{sudo aptitude install python-cjklib}}}.

== Debian ==
Download the .deb from [http://code.google.com/p/cjklib/downloads/list Downloads] and run
{{{dpkg -i python-cjklib_0.2-1_all.deb}}}
