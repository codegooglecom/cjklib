Make sure you have [http://www.python.org/download/ Python 2.5 or newer], [http://www.sqlalchemy.org/download.html SQLalchemy] and [http://www.sqlite.org/download.html SQLite] installed (lets focus on SQLite for now).

= Steps =

  # First download the latest release from [http://code.google.com/p/cjklib/downloads/list Downloads] and unpack it.
  {{{

  # Go to the new directory
