To help you understand where something like cjklib would be useful, here are a few example applications envisioned by the developers during the creation process.

*Romanization of Han characters in a larger project 

When something like conversion to pinyin is required in a software project, usually a "hacky" solution is put in place that is "good enough." Rather than reduplicating the effort in creating a new hacky solution, cjklib can be easily used in many of these situations to provide high quality, high reliability romanization. 

* Dictionary programs

  * [http://code.google.com/p/eclectus/ Eclectus] a small Han character dictionary for learners.

* Something having to do with stroke order 

Chris?

* Consistence checks of dictionary

Use Pinyin romanization handling and data from Unicode's Unihan to crosscheck CEDICT and HanDeDict's entries. Example script: [http://code.google.com/p/cjklib/source/browse/trunk/examples/checkcedict.py trunk/examples/checkcedict.py], list of possibly wrong entries: http://www.stud.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uyhc/en/content/consistency-check-cedict-unihan-pinyin-pronunciations
